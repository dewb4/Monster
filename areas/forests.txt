You are in a foggy forest.
A misty forest surrounds you, engulfed in a damp and ghostly shroud.
You move cautiously through a foggy forest, every rustle or creak sending your heart racing.
You find yourself in a maze of twisted trees and tangled vines.
You are surrounded by gnarled branches and rustling leaves.
